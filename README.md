# Homebridge MQTT Motor as Garage Door

This plugin provides a virtual Garage Door accessory, that uses state of an actual MQTT motor controller for its own state.

## Why?

My Garage Door is basically a Roller Shutter, and I haven't found any Zigbee motor controllers that act as Garage Door Opener.
